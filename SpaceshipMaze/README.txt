Old Unity 3D project.
The purpose of this project was to show a concept of level design, animation, scripting, and game states through a walk-through puzzle.
It may not be shiny, but this was one of the first large projects of my college career, also when Unity was a relatively new industry engine.
Feel free to look around and check out some of the scenery and helmet I made in modeling class. (Still low quality, but I'm a coder not an artist, so I'm proud)
