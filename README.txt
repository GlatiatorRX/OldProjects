These are old inactive projects.
Feel free to use the code you see, none of these projects are still in development or have any monotary value.
Several assets are placeholder assets found online or made in classes, so either use your own or put credit where is due.

Most of these projects are on old versions. Looking at the scripts is possible, but compiling or loading projects in editors may prove to be troublesome due to the version upgrades/downgrades required.
Most core functionailty should be still be intact, but assets may be missing.

If you have any questions about the scripts, feel free to message me.
