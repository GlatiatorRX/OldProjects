This project is using the Leap Motion controller. 
It acts much like a kinect, but instead tracks finger movements. 
The purpose of this project was to design a game for children with autism to focus and refine their motor controls.

You really need a Leap Motion controller to use this, as mouse functionality has been disabled by default.
But scripts related to gameplay, you are free to view and access and copy.
I do not own Leap Motion control rights, but all scripts I have recieved are those you can get from registering with their site online.
Check them out, they are really close and are working closely with Oculus!
