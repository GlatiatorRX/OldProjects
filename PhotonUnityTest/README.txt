This project is to test the Photon networking system in Unity
Currently outdated as of 9/14/16, but Assets/Scripts code should still be usable with new versions, it is the Unity Controller reference that is outdated.
It is a simple shooting, death, respawn, and movement interpolation test project.

All photon scripts can be found online here: https://www.photonengine.com/en-US/PUN
