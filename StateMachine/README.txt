Mid term for AI class.
We were to make a game with a finite state machine.
Ascii version pac man, but the ghosts do not move currently. 
They solely change between hunting mode and running mode if you collect 10 point balls.
Simple, but can build on easily, may complete with proper ghost AI movement when time available.
